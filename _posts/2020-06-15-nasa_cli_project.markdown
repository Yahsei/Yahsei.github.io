It's Monday. I'm starting my CLI project. I decided over the weekend to use the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API to call images from a certain date. The basic idea is that a user can type in a specific date and get back a specific image from that date. Hopefully, if the API works the way I thnk it does, I can also pull the text explanitory information from the API as an optional choice for the user to learn more. I'm hoping that this meets the 1 level deep requirement. I thought about doing this because it's a fun light topic and XML/HTML Scraping is a pain. I want to show that I know what I'm doing in the most pain free way possible.

I was in a study group with our cohort lead, who was talking about making sure not to load too much data because that would ruin load times. I think with the way the data input loads from the API, it should not be a big deal since the reality is we only need to load single data points at a time, even though the user can look at as many as they want. I'm thinking it will be a fairly quick app.

I haven't even touched making a git repository for this yet, but I plan to start today. I'll make my 3 classes, CLI, NASA, and API. Here's hoping to a successful app development adventure.
