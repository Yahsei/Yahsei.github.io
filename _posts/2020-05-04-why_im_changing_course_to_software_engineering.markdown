Hey everyone,

My name is Jesse Summer-Lavigne. I'm a 30 year old working professional living in the Greater Seattle Area. I've worked in the Educational sector for 12+ years in some capacity. I've been treated poorly as a teacher,  worked as a corporate trainer, and most recently got laid off due to the fact that I couldn't travel and train around my state. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to do a career transition, but not in the sense that I can go back to school and get a Computer Science degree. I wanted to get in a field where I could work from home and not worry about my job security. That was my short term decisioin to do a Bootcamp.

There are some more long term reasons that I wanted to switch into coding:

- I have friends in hight level coding positions who have been pushing me for years to work for better companies and make more money.
- I have experience in HTML/CSS/JS since I was 12, but not enough to consider them skills.
- I'm looking to buy a house one day in one of the most volitaile markets in the world. This requires money. Social Services does not pay well.
- I recently got a job working out doing 'Essential Work' outside and my body is already sore from day 1.

Coronavirus was just the scenario that facilitated these reasons becoming more important to me. I want something secure that can provide me a safe living that I know I can do. I know I can code if I put my mind to it and that's what I'm here to do. I'm working 4 days a week and am really only available Monday through Wednesday during the day, but I plan to execute on this hard regardless. This is my goal. I don't plan to fail.

Thanks,
Jesse# Enter your title here
